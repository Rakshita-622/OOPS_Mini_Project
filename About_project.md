# Task Manager / Todo List

## Project Overview

The Task Manager (or Todo List) is a simple yet effective application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently.
This project allows users to add, view, and delete tasks, providing a straightforward interface to keep track of their to-do items.
The application is built using Python as the programming language, with Tkinter as the GUI library and a CSV file for data persistence.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly tool that assists individuals in organizing their tasks and improving productivity.
It serves as a practical introduction to Python programming, file handling, and GUI development using Tkinter.
The Task Manager aims to help users prioritize their tasks, set reminders, and stay focused on their goals.

### Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can easily input new tasks into the system, which are then stored in a CSV file for persistence.
- **View Tasks**: The application displays all tasks in a list format, allowing users to see their current to-do items at a glance.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed, helping to keep their task list clean and relevant.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in a CSV file, ensuring that users' data is saved even after closing the application.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The GUI is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear labels and minimal clutter.

### Technical Details

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **GUI Library**: Tkinter
- **Data Storage**: CSV file
- **File Handling**: The application uses Python's built-in `csv` module to read and write data to the CSV file.

### Expected Outcomes

By completing this project, users will gain hands-on experience in:

- Building a basic GUI application using Tkinter.
- Implementing file handling in Python for data persistence.
- Understanding the fundamentals of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Organizing code into separate modules for better maintainability.
- Designing a user-friendly interface that is easy to use and navigate.

This project serves as a solid foundation for future enhancements, such as adding features like:

- Task deadlines and reminders
- Priority levels for tasks
- User authentication and authorization
- Data visualization and analytics
- Integration with other tools and services (e.g., calendar, email)

By building this Task Manager application, users will develop essential skills in Python programming, GUI development, and data storage, preparing them for more complex projects and real-world applications.
